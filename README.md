# fizzbuzz
"Fizz buzz (often spelled FizzBuzz in this context) has been used as an interview screening device for computer programmers. Writing a program to output the first 100 FizzBuzz numbers is a trivial problem for any would-be computer programmer, so interviewers can easily filter out those with insufficient programming ability." ~https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz. FizzWriting FizzBuzz is a great way to get insight into someone's programming style. That said, hope you get some into mine.
